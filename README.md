Issues with Divi Modal Login I am building

I am working on a custom Login Modal for my WordPress design (and I have the design on a localhost) I need assistance in figuring
out why the code is breaking and the modal window is showing up behind the main navigation bar.  

** Please excuse sloppy code, it is no where near done, just testing the front end code then I will work on the security.
** Thank you
** Niki
